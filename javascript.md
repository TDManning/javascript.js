## This is the Header

This is my first Github repository

After creating the local file and linking it to the repository, I learned how to push edits from my local repository to Github. Below are the steps that I took.

1. Make changes in VS code. Save them.
2. Add changes to the staging area: **git add <filename>**
3. Commit changes: **git commit -m "Message here"** The message should be in present imparitive tense. Answer, This commit will..."   ". 
4. Send changs to github repository : **git push**
